### **Key Architecture Concepts**

#### **🔧 Engine Architecture (Production Ready)**
```typescript
Modular Engine System:
- Each engine handles a specific domain (drawing, learning, user, etc.)
- Clean APIs with TypeScript interfaces
- Singleton pattern for system-wide state management
- Event-driven communication between engines
- Comprehensive error handling and performance monitoring

Example Usage:
import { profileSystem } from 'src/engines/user/ProfileSystem';
import { skillTreeManager } from 'src/engines/learning/SkillTreeManager';
const user = profileSystem.getCurrentUser();
const lessons = skillTreeManager.getAvailableLessons();
```

#### **🎯 Context Provider System (All Operational)**
```typescript
State Management Hierarchy:
- ThemeContext      → UI theming and color management
- UserProgressContext → User profiles, XP, achievements, progress
- DrawingContext    → Canvas state, tools, layers (NEEDS ENHANCEMENT)
- LearningContext   → Skill trees, lesson progress, assessments

Usage Pattern:
const { user, addXP, addAchievement } = useUserProgress();
const { currentBrush, setColor, layers } = useDrawing();
const { currentLesson, completeLesson } = useLearning();
```

#### **📱 Screen Architecture (Complete Navigation)**
```typescript
Navigation Structure:
app/(tabs)/         # Main application tabs
├── index.tsx      # Home dashboard with progress overview
├── draw.tsx       # Drawing canvas (PRIORITY: Professional upgrade)
├── learn.tsx      # Skill tree navigation and lesson selection
├── gallery.tsx    # Portfolio display and community features
└── profile.tsx    # User profile and achievement display

Special Screens:
app/onboarding.tsx # Complete user onboarding flow
app/lesson/[id].tsx # Individual lesson interface
app/settings.tsx   # App settings and preferences
```

---

## 🎯 **Current Status & Development Priorities**

### **✅ What's Production Ready**
- **User Management**: Complete onboarding, profiles, XP/achievements
- **Navigation**: All screens accessible and functional
- **Learning Framework**: Skill trees, lesson organization, progress tracking
- **Community Framework**: Social features, portfolio, achievements ready
- **Performance**: Monitoring and optimization systems operational
- **Architecture**: Scalable foundation supporting rapid feature development

### **🚨 Current Priority: Professional Drawing Engine**
The basic drawing canvas must be upgraded to Procreate-level capabilities:

```typescript
Current Limitations:
- Basic HTML canvas with simple touch events
- No pressure sensitivity or Apple Pencil optimization
- Single basic brush with limited functionality
- No layer system or professional tools
- Poor performance with complex artwork

Target Professional Features:
- React Native Skia for 60fps graphics rendering
- Apple Pencil Pro with 4096 pressure levels and tilt detection
- 15+ professional brushes with realistic dynamics
- Layer system with blend modes and opacity controls
- High-resolution canvas with smooth zoom capabilities
- Memory optimization for large artwork files
```

### **📋 Next Development Phases**
1. **Professional Drawing Engine** (Current Sprint)
2. **Interactive Learning System** (Next Sprint)  
3. **UI/UX Professional Polish** (Following Sprint)
4. **Analytics & Optimization** (Final Phase)

## 🛠️ **Development Workflow (Google Standards)**

### **Before Starting Work**
```bash
# Always start with clean state
git pull origin main
npm install
npx expo start --clear

# Verify system health
npx tsc --noEmit  # Should show 0 errors
```

### **Code Quality Standards**
```typescript
Required Standards:
✅ TypeScript Strict Mode - All code fully typed
✅ Modular Architecture - Follow engine/context patterns
✅ Performance Monitoring - Maintain 60fps targets
✅ Error Handling - Use ErrorBoundary and errorHandler
✅ Memory Management - Optimize for mobile devices
✅ Testing - Verify on real devices, especially iPad with Apple Pencil

Development Principles:
- Build for scalability (support millions of users)
- Optimize for performance (60fps guaranteed)
- Design for professionals (tools must satisfy working artists)
- Code for maintenance (clean, documented, testable)
```

### **Key Development Files**
```typescript
Core Systems:
src/engines/drawing/ProfessionalCanvas.ts  # 🚨 CURRENT PRIORITY
src/engines/learning/SkillTreeManager.ts   # Lesson management
src/contexts/DrawingContext.tsx            # Canvas state management

## 🎨 **Drawing Engine Development Focus**

### **Current Implementation Status**
```typescript
Drawing System Analysis:
📁 src/engines/drawing/ProfessionalCanvas.ts
- ⚠️  Basic HTML canvas implementation
- ⚠️  Simple touch event handling
- ⚠️  No pressure sensitivity
- ⚠️  Limited brush functionality
- ⚠️  No layer system

Target Professional Implementation:
- ✅ React Native Skia integration for 60fps rendering
- ✅ Apple Pencil Pro pressure and tilt detection
- ✅ Professional brush engine with realistic dynamics
- ✅ Layer system with blend modes and effects
- ✅ High-resolution canvas with smooth zoom
- ✅ Memory optimization for large artwork
```

### **Required Technology Integration**
```typescript
Key Dependencies for Professional Drawing:
- @shopify/react-native-skia    # 60fps graphics rendering
- react-native-gesture-handler  # Advanced touch/pencil input
- Apple Pencil Pro APIs         # Pressure, tilt, squeeze gestures
- Custom brush algorithms       # Realistic brush dynamics
- Memory optimization          # Large canvas performance
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **TypeScript Compilation Issues**
```bash
# Check for errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Common solutions
rm -rf node_modules && npm install  # Clean dependencies
npx expo start --clear               # Clear Metro cache
```

### **Navigation/Context Issues**
```bash
# Error: "useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider"
# Solution: Check app/_layout.tsx has all providers wrapped correctly

# Error: "Unmatched Route" 
# Solution: Ensure screen files exist and are properly exported
```

### **Drawing Canvas Issues**
```bash
# Canvas not responding to touch
# Check: Drawing context provider and event handlers
# Verify: Canvas element is properly initialized

# Performance issues during drawing
# Check: Frame rate monitoring in PerformanceMonitor
# Verify: Memory usage optimization
```

### **Device-Specific Testing**
```typescript
Required Test Devices:
- iPad Pro with Apple Pencil (primary target)
- iPhone Pro (secondary target)
- Android tablet with stylus (future support)

Critical Test Scenarios:
- Extended drawing sessions (30+ minutes)
- Complex artwork with multiple layers
- Apple Pencil pressure and tilt response
- Memory usage with large canvases
- Performance during zoom and pan operations
```
